# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a detailed **Road Accident Analysis** dashboard built in Power BI. The dashboard presents a comprehensive, interactive view of road accident data, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify trends, spot risk factors, and make data-driven decisions for road safety improvements.

## Key Features

- **Executive Summary Metrics**
  - **Total CY Casualties:** 195.7K (_-11.9% compared to previous year_)
  - **Total CY Accidents:** 144.4K (_-11.7%_)
  - **CY Fatal Casualties:** 2.9K (_-3.6%_)
  - **CY Serious Casualties:** 27.0K (_-14.5%_)
  - **CY Slight Casualties:** 165.8K (_-10.8%_)

- **Casualties Breakdown by Vehicle Type**
  - **Cars** account for the vast majority of casualties (155,804), highlighting their dominance in overall traffic and risk.
  - **Vans** and **bikes** also show significant casualty counts (15,905 and 15,610, respectively).
  - **Agricultural vehicles** and **buses** have much lower involvement, but may indicate different risk profiles (rural/urban, commercial use, etc.).

- **Monthly Trend Analysis**
  - The dashboard visualizes monthly fluctuations compared to the previous year, revealing seasonal peaks and troughs.
  - This allows for the identification of high-risk periods (e.g., increased accidents in summer months) and supports targeted interventions.

- **Urban vs. Rural Distribution**
  - **Urban** areas account for 61.95% of casualties, compared to 38.05% in **rural** areas.
  - Urban concentration suggests higher traffic density and possibly more minor collisions, while rural accidents may have a higher severity rate.

- **Road Type Risk Assessment**
  - **Single carriageways** are the most dangerous, with 145K casualties, far exceeding other road types.
  - **Dual carriageways** (32K), **roundabouts** (13K), **one way streets**, and **slip roads** (3K each) contribute less, but may present unique hazards.

- **Impact of Lighting Conditions**
  - 73.84% of casualties occur during the **day**, but 26.16% at **night** (dark), which, considering reduced night-time traffic, suggests disproportionately higher risk per journey at night.

- **Geographic Hotspots**
  - The interactive map pinpoints accident hotspots, facilitating localized safety campaigns and infrastructure improvements.

- **Filtering Capabilities**
  - Users can filter data by **road surface** and **weather conditions** to analyze accident causes and risk factors under different environments.

## Analytical Insights

- **Year-on-Year Safety Improvements:** Significant reductions across all accident and casualty types indicate effective policy measures or behavior changes. Continuous monitoring is needed to sustain this trend.
- **Vehicle Type Disparities:** Cars are involved in the vast majority of casualties, but bikes and vans also represent vulnerable road user segments, meriting targeted safety campaigns.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Monthly trend analysis can uncover links between accidents and factors such as school holidays, weather changes, or events.
- **Urban vs Rural Risks:** While most casualties are urban, rural accidents may be more severe due to higher speeds and delayed emergency response.
- **Single Carriageways:** These roads are a clear focus area for safety interventions, with the highest accident/casualty counts.
- **Night-Time Risk:** Nighttime accidents, while fewer in total, are likely more severe and may require interventions such as improved lighting, visibility campaigns, or speed management.
- **Geographic Focus:** Mapping enables targeted deployment of resourcesâ€”such as speed cameras, signage, or educationâ€”in high-risk zones.
